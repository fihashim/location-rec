I moved to Germany. So, I had to continue my tradition of 'exquisitenes'. BUT... to my surprise I had to face a lot of UPs and DOWNs regarding Domino's.\nFirstly, the closest Domino's to Essen was the one in Velbert (17 km away) and the stretch...YES, it was reaaaally worth it. Just like before, same delicious garlic sauce (from which I bought separately 40 of them just to have at home :D)...the good old pizza!\nNext time I went there, to my surprise...the shop was closed (forever!); no note, nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zero.\nSo,...I sighed and waited patiently the next ocassion to put my hands on a Domino's Pizza.\nJACKPOT!!! In a few months a Domino's Franchise was opened...guess where...in Essen. Yahoo!\nI was a bit puzzled when I got there. Different menus, different sauce size (and different look), different prices, different Pizza boxes and also the thing I was most afraid of: different recipe. It left me with a bad taste, both ways. But hey, it could have been a bad day for the guys so I ordered again from there; BIIIG mistake; I should have listened to my guts.\nLong time, no eat. I / or Domino's Pizza in Germany got a new chance. In Hamburg. We thought...why not build our own usual pizzas so as to compare it with the ones before. If the pizza in Essen was eatable but not preferable anymore I can only say that in Hamburg we each ordered a big pizza, from which we each ate one slice and...the rest of it someone on the street seemed to be grateful for.\nNext: Düsseldorf. First time, last time!\nToulouse (France) seemed to me that maybe will be different than the recipe in Germany. It was the same...'difference'.\nIt made no difference anymore.\nI was already fed up with Domino's.\n\nBut here I am...ordering Domino's again. I was thinking: man, since I will anyway be here (Berlin) for a short while, why not just try it 'cause afterwards I will anyway not order anymore.\nSo, I was kind of 'afraid' but I was expecting it this time. No alarms and no surprises!..\n\nI was like: oh my GOOOOSH, this is good. I ate a big pizza and when I finished it I wanted another one :D.\nToday, I was like: I either do the most stupid spending of all times or I get myself not one, not 2, but 3 slices of heaven. I was again afraid because I was thinking that that pizza was good by mistake.\n\nAnd I ordered (the heaven part)! As you can see in the image, the pizzas were already with me but the delivery has not even started in the live preview. They were hot, gorgeously looking ... pizzas!\nYou know that feeling when there is something soooo goooood that you cannot stop eating but you know you have to stop, otherwise you will be like a bug with the belly button up... yeah... I had to stop or I would have faced the acidity week :D\n\nAnyway, long story short: I do not like to leave comment and reviews BUT in this case...

The Museum Island was crowded with visitors relaxing and enjoying the sun. The Forum is located at the center of the island, and next to the subway line 5. The visit to Humboldt Forum was very pleasant. The collections are mostly free. Couple of highlights about its facility: 1. lockers and cloakroom allows flight carry on size luggage, and check them for visitors for free. 2. There is a bistro with various reasonably priced lunch options. 3. Roof terrace costs 5 Euro for access. But one can make a reservation at its roof terrace restaurant Baret to enjoy a cup of coffee and the Dom view. I went there for its Asian Art collection located on the third floor, and happily surprised with its temporary collections there, especially with the Wang Shu designed exhibition hall. Of course, one question the visitors might have after reading the descriptions of some of the objects in the hall is  the museum\'s efforts and role in addressing the ethical dilemma of preserving those admittedly ""looted"" during the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the Forum also made efforts in including more English language description of objects that\'s more friendly to non-German speaking visitors. At the beginning of the Asian Art collection, there is also a timeline of the transformation of its collection since 19th century. One suggestion for future improvement of presenting such a timeline is to use different colors for English and German texts, and explain acronyms on the side. It would be easier for the visitors to follow.', ""Lovely and magical place, for me it's one of the best places and one of the  best areas in Berlin.

The Museum Island was crowded with visitors relaxing and enjoying the sun. The Forum is located at the center of the island, and next to the subway line 5. The visit to Humboldt Forum was very pleasant. The collections are mostly free. Couple of highlights about its facility: 1. lockers and cloakroom allows flight carry on size luggage, and check them for visitors for free. 2. There is a bistro with various reasonably priced lunch options. 3. Roof terrace costs 5 Euro for access. But one can make a reservation at its roof terrace restaurant Baret to enjoy a cup of coffee and the Dom view. I went there for its Asian Art collection located on the third floor, and happily surprised with its temporary collections there, especially with the Wang Shu designed exhibition hall. Of course, one question the visitors might have after reading the descriptions of some of the objects in the hall is  the museum\'s efforts and role in addressing the ethical dilemma of preserving those admittedly ""looted"" during the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the Forum also made efforts in including more English language description of objects that\'s more friendly to non-German speaking visitors. At the beginning of the Asian Art collection, there is also a timeline of the transformation of its collection since 19th century. One suggestion for future improvement of presenting such a timeline is to use different colors for English and German texts, and explain acronyms on the side. It would be easier for the visitors to follow.', ""Lovely and magical place, for me it's one of the best places and one of the  best areas in Berlin. Not only is the museum free, but it contains great exposition and great items inside.\n\nThere is an observatory which is around 5 euros to access but you'll have one of the best views in Berlin.

I went there for its Asian Art collection located on the third floor, and happily surprised with its temporary collections there, especially with the Wang Shu designed exhibition hall. Of course, one question the visitors might have after reading the descriptions of some of the objects in the hall is  the museum\'s efforts and role in addressing the ethical dilemma of preserving those admittedly ""looted"" during the Boxer Rebellion. Overall, the Forum also made efforts in including more English language description of objects that\'s more friendly to non-German speaking visitors. At the beginning of the Asian Art collection, there is also a timeline of the transformation of its collection since 19th century. One suggestion for future improvement of presenting such a timeline is to use different colors for English and German texts, and explain acronyms on the side.

I guess the trigger was one of the very first articles I‘ve read about the „Peking/Kreuzberg Duck Menu“ and the (intrinsic) stopper probably was the restaurant being a „hotel restaurant“. I‘ve to admit, I gave the place a first check by visiting the Bar for some drinks after a stroll with a friend on Oranienstreet the other day. And guess what, our Bar experience was amazing!\nSo the Orania Restaurant became my very first choice for this year’s birthday dinner, to finally go for the „mysterious“ Kreuzberg Duck (X-Bergs answer to the Peking Duck)! Not sure if there’s a word cut here and therefore giving the executive summary first: w/o question… one of the top 5 culinary experiences in Berlin for me over the past 21years I‘d the pleasure of living & enjoying many-many wonderful & inspirational culinary events here.\nNo way of mentioning even some of them here w/o dissing/missing others. As well I‘d the opportunity to run some wonderful & mystic places as part of an awesome team myself.\nOk. Let’s cut the marketing blabla. Listen folks, as a trained chef, a foodie & service lover by DNA as well as someone who fully gets, reads & understands the challenges of the moment, this experience was simply „Extraordinary“!\nThe four course Kreuzberg Duck menu has been one of the top notch culinary & value4money experiences in Berlin EVER! On top of that the food was accompanied by an out of ordinary level of service. I‘d guess, that over the 4 courses we‘d had a minimum of 10 different service & chef people at the table. Might sound stressful, but believe me, it was a pure pleasure to get to know every single one of them, especially because of their so much away from average commitment & positive energy which came with each & everyone!\nFolks, hands on my heart, I paid the full bill and this feedback is 100% personal, not paid at all and simply based on my beliefs to „give back“!\nBefore ending, my wife’s favorite part of a menu is the dessert (-> yeahhh, she’s a true sweetheart 😍) and even here, these crazy folks not only send their „TV style Pattissière“ to our table, but she also dropped some freaking amazing, no chi-chi & simply really tasty desserts.\nOk. I get it. It’s seems far too much for an unpaid review, but hej, how much crap, average, overrated and simply „not ever come back shit“ have you been going through!?\nSo I thought, I‘d might want to allow myself to get really carried away for once 😉!\nAgain, very personal, very much of a Monday evening and very-very slightly infused by birthday emotions.\nSimply fueled by a very special experience, which I believe needs to be shared! N-joy folks!', ""Returning to Orania for my second visit was an absolute delight. Nestled within a charming hotel, this restaurant offers a unique dining experience where the open kitchen concept takes center stage. Being able to watch the culinary team at work adds an intimate touch to the meal, bridging the gap between chef and diner.\n\nThe food, without a doubt, was exceptional. Each dish was a sophisticated blend of flavors, clearly showcasing the kitchen's dedication to quality and creativity. What stood out just as much was the professionalism and attentiveness of the staff. Their attention to detail ensured a flawless dining experience from start to finish.\n\nI left Orania feeling thoroughly impressed once again. For anyone looking for an exquisite dining experience in Berlin, I wholeheartedly recommend Orania. It's not just a meal; it's an experience that speaks to the senses and lingers in memory."", 'Everything is almost OK. In my opinion, the last course, which is fried rice, could be better, why?
