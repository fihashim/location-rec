We were welcomed and seated immediately upon arrival but then had to wait nearly 20 minutes before staff took drink orders. The starter wasn’t served until almost an hour after we arrived.

The dessert was served at about 20.00, so luckily it wasn’t as tight as feared.\nYet again when we had finished our meal we also had to wait a long time at the bar to get to pay our bill.\n\nUnfortunately staff did not have time to pay much attention to our table during our stay. By the time we left staff had not taken a single drink-order from us, we had to make the request and generally it took some effort and waiting to communicate, as they were super busy running back and forth. Even presenting the menu and taking orders they appeared in a rush, talking very fast and «on the go».\n\nStarter:\nThe seasoned bread was nice but dry. Some of the dishes that we expected to be served warm arrived cold at the table. Unsure if it was supposed to be like that, but the grilled cauliflower, falafel and roasted potatoes would have been nice served warm. The potatoes were somewhat chewy and falafel was not moist like before, unfortunately dry. The hummus was lovely, like before, however served with much added tahini now which camouflaged the hummus flavour and made it somewhat bland.\n\nMains:\nBy the time our mains arrived we were starting to feel full already. So great value for money, but quite overwhelming.\n\nDessert:\nCoconunt pannacotta with pistachio crumble and a fruit sauce was lovely, but then again we were very, very full at this point.\n\nAll in all we spent the majority of our visit waiting, and less time enjoying the food and taking the time to process and taste the lovely foods and flavours. Such a shame.\n\nThe large portions are great if you have a big appetite and are a fast eater. We could’ve enjoyed half the size and therefore miss the opportunity of a la carte.\n\nThe belly dancer was definitely a highlight, thank you for the entertaining show and spreading love!\n\nEdit: Would like to add that the staff was very friendly also this time.

First of all, I want to clarify that we were not under stress, so it\'s disappointing to see that assumption made about us. If your staff was feeling stressed, perhaps they need more support or a break, but that doesn’t justify being rude to customers.\n\nTo clarify the situation, we visited your place yesterday and ordered four drinks: two beers and two house lemonades. We intended to pay by card, as we only had €5 in cash. Since you require a deposit for the glasses, we needed an extra €3. However, before we were even served, a staff member impulsively insisted that we pay the deposit upfront.\n\nMy girlfriend then went to ask our friends if they had any extra cash. During this time, one of your ""friendly staff"" started mocking her and even called her a ""gröserlig.""\n\nThis kind of behavior is unacceptable, regardless of how busy or stressful the environment might be. We understand that everyone can have an off day, but we expect a certain level of respect when we visit an establishment. I hope you can address this internally so that future customers don\'t have a similar experience.\n\nThank you for your time.', ""I visited this bar last week with my husband and small child, and our experience was highly disappointing. After buying drinks, we were sitting there for half an hour when, five minutes before the Germany game started, they abruptly kicked us out. They claimed the area we were in was reserved for their friends, despite there being no reservation sign and the place being semi-empty. We even asked everyone around if the seats were free, and no one indicated otherwise.\n\nOur child was very upset, and we had to leave despite there being plenty of space available. To make matters worse, they only accept cash payments, which raises some questions in this day and age.\n\nMost importantly, the staff showed zero empathy for a family with a small child who was clearly distressed about being kicked out. This is simply unacceptable behavior. If you're a family, avoid this place at all costs.

I chose this restaurant because my dad was in town, we love italian food so after reading the extraordinary good reviews and seeing the nice website with a nice menu selection, I wanted to give it a try.\n(I worked years in restaurants and I am a big foodie, especially for my italian food, so I love to try new stuff, because why not, it‘s berlin right?)\n\nThe place:\nWe get there and it is just a brightly lit room with a big window so you can see the whole restaurant. Because the first impression was sadly uninviting (compared to other romantic italian places in berlin) I even had to check if that is the right restaurant because the place looked nothing like the photos, but we were right.\nThe atmosphere and ambiance was just… cold. You walk straight into the dining area with tables scrambled together, bright lights, no candles, no nice tablecloths, just straight up cheap tables and chairs. The chairs are unfortunately also so uncomfortable, that we wanted to go right after eating. For every restaurant, but especially italian, I want to be comfortable. I want to feel at home. I want the feeling I am in Italy right now and I can sit and sit forever and just have nice hour long conversations over a bottle or two of red wine. But all I got from there was just a reaction to stand up and go. I‘m sorry to be so direct but I have no other way to describe it.\nThe most sad part about it: one reason I chose the restaurant was by the way they decorated and printed their menu. (It sounds dumb but after years of trying new restaurants you know when they put in the work for a nice menu, they will do with everything else as well).\nSo I was flabbergasted when the waiter just lay the menu cards down, which were just flipchart boards with a old laminated printed out sheet of paper.\n\nThe food:\nWell the food. As stated above we ended up paying 180€ for 3 persons, which isn’t THAT much for berlin, but everytime I pay that much I get a really overall nice experience from the places. So, as you can imagine, this place was nowhere near that.\nMy girlfriend and I had roman artichokes as starters, my dad had porchetta with radicchio. The artichokes were ok, but they just tasted… bland (i guess?!), my dad described as: „They lack the kick“. The porchetta was fine.\nFor main we had: octopus, ravioli with cod and tagliolini with calamaretti.\nAnd now it got disappointing for that price: my dad had the octopus main and he got 2 half arms. Like maybe 100g, if even. It tasted good, a little bit too long cooked on one side, so octopus gets rubbery. But like the size was just a joke. I‘m sorry to be so blunt. This dish was 28€(!). I had the ravioli and also here taste was ok, but they lacked a bit of everything and for about 26€ it was just to small (had like 7 ravioli) and too little kick to it. My gf had the tagliolini, which was surprisingly a huge portion, compared to ours. I just don‘t get their measurements of plating?\nWell the taste was also good but lacked something and were a bit to bitter. I mean that‘s a dish for normally around 16-18€ and it was also like 26€.\n\nSo all in all I want to say that the food was not bad or uneatable. But we paid 180€ which is just not right for what you get. A ok-quality food with lack of passion behind the taste and an unromantic atmosphere where you don’t want to stay hours.\nSo my rating is 2 stars for that the food was ok and the chef was nice, but I‘m sorry. Didn‘t get the vibe and sadly not something to visit again.']","[2, 5, 2]"

Such intriguing dining concepts are becoming increasingly popular worldwide. This DarkRestaurant offers a dining experience shrouded in complete darkness, served by visually impaired waitstaff. The prospect was intriguing, yet no amount of anticipation could truly prepare me for the depth of the experience that lay ahead. In this environment, ""utter darkness"" means the absence of all light, making it impossible to see anything at all.\n\nUpon our arrival, the hostess warmly greeted my date and me, taking our coats and presenting a menu that outlined meal types rather than specific dishes—poultry, seafood, beef, or vegetarian options, with a selection of drinks. I opted for the vegetarian, and my date chose beef. We were then led by our blind server, Heedi, in a conga line fashion into the pitch-black dining area, a journey that set the stage for an evening unlike any other.\n\nSeated and acquainted with our surroundings through touch—silverware, glasses, and more—courtesy of Heedi\'s guidance, we awaited our meal. The palpable darkness soon unsettled us, a feeling exacerbated by the inability of our eyes to adjust or find light. To distract from the discomfort, we engaged in conversation.\n\nThe meal began with bread that, to my discerning palate, immediately felt unworthy of indulgence. A playful moment ensued when my date, attempting to lighten the mood, inadvertently launched a piece of crust into my eye. Despite the mishap, we navigated the challenges of sharing dishes and experiencing the meal without sight, which proved messy yet enlightening. Our main courses arrived, and though my initial impression was of a simple salad, I was actually enjoying a complex dish of lime-marinated beetroot with a mint topping, a discovery that underscored how much sight influences taste.\n\nThis dining-in-the-dark experience taught us valuable lessons about the reliance on visual cues in culinary enjoyment and the profound impact of sight on our dining experiences. Despite the average quality of the meals, the unique environment made for a memorable evening, though not one we\'re likely to repeat. The experience served as a reminder of the importance of sight and the intriguing ways in which its absence can alter perception, conversation, and even the ambiance of a meal. Dining in the dark offers a one-of-a-kind experience that goes beyond food to challenge and enlighten the senses in unexpected ways.', ""I absolutely adored the experience and the atmosphere!

Very friendly and very helpful.\nThe food was excellent. Delicious and well seasoned.', 'I struggle eating this place. It is what it is and you get what you expect. Classic Croatian meat platters, skewers and steaks. It comes with real 80s charm. The decoration, the furniture as well as the drapes. But sometimes this is exactly what I‘m craving for. And among Croatian places across Berlin this is probably my favorite. The owner is super nice and funny, the portions are generous and prices are ok. And the atmosphere is what it is. Either you love it or you hate it. When I crave for Croatian in Berlin I also want this atmosphere. Exactly this atmosphere.']","[5, 5, 5]"

The 4 courses dinner was nice but too pricey vs the relative simplicity of the meals on my opinion. The service was nice even though the staff was changing 4 times during the service which was a bit confusing. The atmosphere is nice but not more than this, it didn\'t feel as an exceptional design effort as it could be the case in some other places with a similar price for example. The food itself was good actually, but not at the level where I\'d expect it to be for a similar price. It\'s German cuisine and not knowing it that much, I\'d say it didn\'t leave any special memory compared to similar experiences with French or Japanese ones for a similar price.\nGenerally speaking, I\'d say it\'s a very nice place but too expensive (overpriced) versus it\'s taste experience.', 'We had a three course menu that was absolutely delicious. Clean and fresh flavors that were well balanced in a relaxed atmosphere added to the relaxed vibe.
